# The ".vscode" Folder
This folder is for the word library used with the VS Code extension LTeX. It could be git ignored, but I would like my library of text corrects to carry over between computers.

# What Is This?
This is simply a website I made some time back for one of my classes. It's in another repo as well though it's uploaded here for the purpose of it being available on my ePortfolio.
